# SecretSantaAssigner
During the holiday season, my friends and I decided to do a fun Secret Santa gift exchange, but since we had to do everything virtually, and couldn't just draw names from a hat, I decided to put my coding skills to the test and designed a program which assigns everyone a person that they have to gift. My program takes advantage of the Circularly Linked List data structure, each node is a person and the next node that they point to is their partner. I also used JavaMail to email the results in order to maintain secrecy.

INSTRUCTIONS:

First you will need to add activation.jar and javax.mail.jar to the build path.

In order to get it working with your own friend group, replace the names and email addresses in the Main.java file. Make sure to keep the names and emails of each person in the same row of the 2D String array, otherwise it will mix everything up.

Then replace the fromEmail and password Strings in the method traverseSend() in RoleAssigner.java 



Have Fun :)
